# R_Demos
Demos for Statistical purposes. The files in this directory are created for statistical teaching purposes, aimed at a deeper understanding of methods and concepts that arise frequently for a researcher dealing with quantitative data. 

* [Boxplots_Variance.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K4tana/R_Demos/main/Boxplots_Variance.R) shows how boxplots can differ with n and what they mean for significant difference in terms of standard deviation/variance. Alpha is also discussed.
